### Notes

  1. If you use a variable after declaration but didn't assign a value to it, there will be a compiler error. 
  2. Contructor
  * `new String()` is a constructor that constructs a new String object. 
  * The assignment "=" causes myString to \_reference_  the object. 
  * `String()` could be called as a constructor signature
  3. Try to compile and run Java files from command line.
  4. declare, construct, and assign
  5. 

  ```java
  String s = new String();
  s = "Yow!";
  ```
  variable s first reference to the new created empty String obj, then change to the new created "Yow!" String obj. 
  6. 

  ```java
  String s2 = s
  ```
  s2 and s reference to the same String. 
  ```java
  String s2 = new String(s)
  ```
  s2 reference to a new String that is identical to the String s reference to.
  ```java
  String s;
  String s2;
  s = "Yow!"
  s2 = "Yow!"
  ```
  in this case, Java might reuse the same obj "Yow!", which means s and s2 might point to the same String obj. But if you use `s2 = new String(s)`, it forces Java to creat a new obj. 
  7. `s2 = new String(s)` Java does at least 5 steps:
 - look where s points 
 - follows reference to String obj
 - reads String
 - constructs new String w/ copy of characters
 - makes s2 reference new String
  8. __3 String constructors__:
  - `new String()`
  - `"Yow!"`
  - `new String(s)`
  9. Constructors always have same name as their class, like `String`, except for `"stuff in quotes"`
  10. __METHODS__
  
  ```java
  s2 = s.toUppercase();
  String s3 = s2.concat("!!");// s3 = s2 + "!!";
  String s4 = "*".concat(s2).concat("*"); //s4 = "*" + s2 + "*";
  ```
  The object "Yow!" did ___not___ change. You couldn't change the characters of an existing String. Their contents never change. If you want to make some change, you have to construct a new String. 
  11. ***I/O classes & Objects***
  Objects in System class interacting with a user:
  - `System.out` is a `PrintStream object` that outputs to the screen. 
  Here it actually means `System.out` ***`reference`*** a `PrintStream object`
  - `System.in` is an `InputStream object` that reads from the keyboards. 
  - readLine is defined on `BufferedReader obj`
     -  How do we construct a `BufferedReader`? with an `InputStreamReader`
     -  How do we construct a `InputStreamReader`? with an `InputStream`
     -  How do we construct a `InputStream`? `System.in` is one.
    
     Figure this out via online Java libraries API - ***`java.io`***
     `InputStream` reads raw data.
     `InputStreamReader` compare into characters (2 bytes long).
     `BufferedReader` compose into entire lines of text.
